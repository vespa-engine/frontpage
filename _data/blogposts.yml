- title: "Accelerating Transformer-based Embedding Retrieval with Vespa"
  excerpt: "In this post, we’ll see how to accelerate embedding inference and retrieval with little impact on quality. We’ll take a holistic approach and deep-dive into both aspects of an embedding retrieval system: Embedding inference and retrieval with nearest neighbor search."
