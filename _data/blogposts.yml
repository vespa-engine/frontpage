  excerpt: "<p>This post is about an idea that was born at the <a href=\"https://tickets.plainschwarz.com/bbuzz23/\">Berlin Buzzwords 2023</a> conference and its journey towards the production-ready implementation of the new <a href=\"https://lucene.apache.org/\">Apache Lucene</a>-based <a href=\"https://docs.vespa.ai/en/linguistics.html\">Vespa Linguistics component</a>.The primary goal of the Lucene linguistics is to make it easier to migrate existing search applications from Lucene-based search engines to Vespa.Also, it can help improve your current Vespa applications.More on that next!</p>"
