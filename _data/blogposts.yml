- title: "Representing BGE embedding models in Vespa using bfloat16 "
  excerpt: "This post demonstrates how to use recently announced BGE embedding models in Vespa. We evaluate the effectiveness of two BGE variants on the BEIR trec-covid dataset. Finally, we demonstrate how Vespa’s support for storing and indexing vectors using bfloat16 precision saves 50% of memory and storage footprint with close to zero loss in retrieval quality."

- title: "Accelerating Transformer-based Embedding Retrieval with Vespa"
  excerpt: "In this post, we’ll see how to accelerate embedding inference and retrieval with little impact on quality. We’ll take a holistic approach and deep-dive into both aspects of an embedding retrieval system: Embedding inference and retrieval with nearest neighbor search."
