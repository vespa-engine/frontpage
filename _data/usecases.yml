  description: Vespa is a fully featured search engine and vector database. It supports vector search (ANN),
    lexical search, and search in structured data, all in the same query.
    Integrated machine-learned model inference allows you to apply AI to make sense of your data in real time. 
    Together with Vespa's proven scaling and high availability, this empowers you to create production ready
    search applications at any scale, and with any combination of features.

  description: Recommendation, personalization and targeting involves evaluating recommender
    models over content items to select the best ones. Vespa lets you build applications which do this online,
    typically combining fast vector search and filtering with evaluation of machine-learned models
    over the items. This makes it possible to make recommendations specifically for each user or situation, using
    completely up to date information.

  description: Large language models are revolutionary, but their usefulness for real tasks
    is limited by their lack of memory, trustworthiness, specific knowledge, and ability
    to reason in many steps. To make more useful agents we must give the models the ability
    to store and search vector and text data in real time, and orchestrate many such
    operations to carry out a task. Vespa is the ideal platform for this, as it integrates 
    all these building blocks in scalable form.

  description: Applications such as e-commerce use a combination of
    structured data and text and need to provide structured navigation - grouping data dynamically
    for navigation and filtering - in combination with search and recommendation.
    Vespa provides all the features required for this with great performance, which makes it possible to
    realize functionally complete applications leveraging structured data on a unified architecture.
