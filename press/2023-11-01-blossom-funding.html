    Blossom Capital</h3>

    <em>Leveraged by the world’s leading tech, retail, and financial services companies, its search platform Vespa is
        positioned to fuel continued growth among Fortune 500 & enterprise clients.</em>

<p><b>November 1, 2023</b></p>

<p><b>Trondheim, Norway—</b>Today <a href="https://vespa.ai">Vespa.ai</a>, an AI pioneer providing advanced
    capabilities and infrastructure for applications to leverage AI and data online at scale, announced it has raised
    USD $31 million in Series A funding from London-based Blossom Capital to further develop its search platform Vespa
    and Vespa Cloud service.</p>

<p>Vespa.ai, which spun out of Yahoo as a standalone company last month after many years of driving AI innovation for
    the internet giant, helps clients—including Spotify, Yahoo, and Fortune 500 companies—apply AI to store, sift
    through, and apply unlimited quantities of data to surface actionable intelligence and insights to meet their users’
    needs in real time.</p>

<p>“As companies around the world race to adopt and adapt to AI, they face significant technical and financial burdens.
    Vespa’s unprecedented capabilities and functionalities, built on two decades of use and development, allow
    organizations of all sizes to realize their AI ambitions at scale while dramatically limiting cost and processing
    times and improving user experience,” said Jon Bratseth, CEO of Vespa.ai. “The investment from Blossom will allow us
    to further increase functionality and provide our end-to-end services to a larger number of enterprise clients.”</p>

<p>Vespa's vast functionality includes scanning billions of documents for global financial institutions to streamline
    client services or ensure compliance, enhancing ad relevance at checkout for leading online retailers to drive up
    check average, and providing global social media platforms with better content suggestions to keep users engaged.
    Its open-source nature further underscores its appeal, with more than ten million downloads on Docker Hub, making it
    a trusted choice for enterprises globally.</p>

<p>Vespa offers an integrated approach for applying AI to data during serving time, using vectors, tensors, text,
    structured data or any combination to provide high-quality solutions catered to diverse use cases, from search and
    retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to recommendation and ad targeting. Vespa takes responsibility for the needs of
    applications from end to end, including managing the data and performing model inferences directly where it resides,
    allowing applications developed on Vespa to scale to any amount of data, load or complexity.</p>

<p>“Enterprise AI has a scaling problem, and Vespa’s cutting-edge technology is a big part of the solution,” said
    Ophelia Brown, Founder of Blossom Capital. “Vespa has been battle-tested by leading Fortune 500 companies in media,
    finance, search, advertising, and e-commerce. It’s light-years ahead of anything else on the market, and Blossom is
    thrilled to help them take things to the next level.”</p>

<p>Vespa also solves the operational challenges that emerge as AI applications, particularly language apps, increase the
    number of customers and amount of data needed to function at scale. Vespa solves this problem by providing the
    capacity and functionality to scale any amount of data, load, or complexity and provide top-tier search results with
    sophisticated scoring and relevance.</p>
