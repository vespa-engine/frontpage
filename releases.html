                <p>Vespa is released every Monday through Thursday. Each public release has passed all our
                    functional and performance tests, and is already running the applications on our
                    public cloud service.

                <p>
                    For each release of Vespa we provide the following artifacts:
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                  <li><a href="https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.yahoo.vespa/parent">Java artifacts for building Vespa applications on Maven Central</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/vespa/vespa/">Vespa RPMs on Fedora Copr</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vespaengine/vespa">Container images on Docker Hub</a></li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Vespa uses <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/en/vespa-versions.html">semantic versioning</a>.
                    Each release is backwards compatible and supports live migration on running systems.
                    It is therefore a minor version number change. All new features are released on such minor versions.
                    Every second year or so we make a major version change which removes previously deprecated
                    functionality.
