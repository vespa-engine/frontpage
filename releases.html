                    Vespa is released every Monday through Thursday. Each public release has passed all
                    functional and performance tests, and is already running the applications on our
                    public cloud service.

                <h2 id="versions">Versions</h2>
                <p>
                    Vespa uses <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>.
                    Each release is backwards compatible and supports live migration on running systems, provided they
                    are running a version which is less than 2 months old.
                    It is therefore a minor version number change. All new features are released on such minor versions.
                    Every second year or so we make a major version change which removes previously deprecated
                    functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Java APIs, web service APIs and all application package constructs are supported through a major release
                    and only removed on a new release if they are already marked deprecated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use of deprecated Java APIs will cause a warning on compilation,
                    and use of deprecated application package constructs will cause a deprecation warning on deployment.
                    Note that Java APIs come in two categories:
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><em>Public APIs</em> carry the compatibility guarantee and are visible from your code
                        as well as in the javadoc</li> <!-- ToDo javadoc - link to something here if possible -->
                    <li><em>Exported APIs</em> are also visible from your code,
                        but is not in the public Javadoc and carry no compatibility guarantee</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Check the Javadoc list to verify that you are using public packages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, some public Java classes and methods are marked with the com.yahoo.api.annotations.Beta tag.
                    These are under development and may still change before they stabilize.
                </p>



                <h2 id="stored-data">Stored Data</h2>

                <p>
                    Data written to Vespa is compatible between adjacent releases.
                    For self-hosted systems, it may be necessary to upgrade through each
                    minor release rather than in larger leaps to ensure Vespa can read existing data.
                    This is a good practice in any case.
