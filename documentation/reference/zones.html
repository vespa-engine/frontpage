title: Zones
---

<p>An application can be deployed to a <i>zone</i>, which is a combination of an <a href="environments.html">environment</a>
and a <i>region</i>. This lists all the zones which can be deployed to manually (dev and perf), deployed to in production
using <a href="deployment.html">deployment.xml</a> (prod), or which is
<a href="../automated-deployments.html">implicitly used to verify prod deployments</a> (test and staging).</p>

<p>Available zones:</p>

<table class="table table-striped">

<tr><th style="width:80px">Environment<th>Region</tr>

<tr><td><a href="environments.html#dev">dev</a>        <td>aws-us-east-1c</tr>
<tr><td><a href="environments.html#test">test</a>      <td>aws-us-east-1c</tr>
