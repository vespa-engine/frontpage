        <h2 id="text-search">Text search</h2>
        <p>
          Vespa is a full-featured text search engine with full support for traditional information retrieval
          as well as modern embedding based techniques. Moreover, since these approaches can be combined efficiently
          in the same query and ranking model, it's easy to use elements of both in the same application,
          something no other technologies can do currently but which is usually necessary to get good results in
          real applications. Search applications usually make use of these features of Vespa:

      <div class="flex-column">
        <h2 id="recommendation-and-personalization">Recommendation and personalization</h2>
        <p>
          Recommendation, content personalization and ad targeting is all the same thing when it comes to
          implementation: For a given user or context, evaluate machine-learned content recommender models
          to find the best items and show them to the user. Usually it is also necessary to filter out
          unwanted items based on metadata, such as e.g language used, or remaining ad budget.
          In addition it is often necessary to group the recommended items to make browsing easier or
          filter out those that are too similar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vespa makes it possible to do the whole process online, at the moment
          when the recommendation is needed, which ensures recommendations are up to date and makes it affordable
          to make them specifically for each user or situation. These features of Vespa are usually leveraged:

          These example open source Vespa recommendation applications can be used as a starting point:

    <div>
      <div class="flex-column">
        <h2 id="question-answering">Question answering</h2>
        <p>
          Question answering provides direct answers to user's question. This is needed in chat bots,
          virtual assistants and similar, and is also becoming an expected feature of high-end search solutions, where
          a direct answer is provided on queries that seem to be questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          A high quality question answerer works as follows: Text snippets are represented by vector embeddings
          which are indexed for fast matching with
          <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/en/approximate-nn-hnsw.html">ANN</a>.
          The best candidates found by ANN matching are evaluated in a
          transformer based language model which outputs the score of the snippet as well as the beginning and
          end of the text answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using Vespa, the entire process can be implemented as an application on a
          single platform, and made to execute with a latency of a few tens of milliseconds while scaling to any
          volume, while delivering quality on par with the research state of the art.

        <h2 id="semi-structured-navigation">Semi-structured navigation</h2>
        <p>
          Applications that use semi-structured data - that is a combination of data-base like data and plain text -
          usually benefit from allowing users to navigate in the data using both structured navigation and
          <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/en/text-matching-ranking.html">text search</a>.
          The most common example of this is e-commerce, or shopping sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          This makes use of traditional text search in conjunction with
          <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/sorting.html">sorting</a>,
          <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/en/grouping.html">grouping</a> and
          <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/query-language-reference.html#where">"filtering by metadata</a>.
          As any query can be grouped and filtered, this allows users to switch between drilling down by metadata
          and searching by text seamlessly without losing context. Commonly some of the metadata is supplied by
          <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/en/parent-child.html">parent documents</a>
          (such as the merchant of a product). Some e-commerce applications also make use
          of embeddings to provide search, navigation or recommendation in an embedding space.

      <div class="flex-column">
        <h2 id="personal-search">Personal search</h2>
        <p>
          <i>Personal search</i> (not to be confused with <a href="#recommendation-and-personalization">personalization</a>)
          is to provide search in personal collections of data where there is never a need to search across many
          collections in a single query. In such applications it is not cost effective to do the work to maintain global
          reverse indexes and the best solution is to
          <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/en/streaming-search.html">search by streaming</a>
          trough the raw data at query time.
          Latency can still be bounded for arbitrary sized collections as each is distributed over a number of nodes
          to bound the size of a given user's collection on a given node.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vespa provides a <i>streaming</i> mode where the usual functionality of the engine is backed by searching
          streaming through the raw data stored in Vespa, no indexes necessary.
          This allows powerful personal search applications to be implemented easily and cheaply at any scale.

        <h2 id="typeahead-suggestions">Typeahead suggestions</h2>
        <p>
          Many applications which make use of textual input make use of typeahead suggestions,
          where a number of suggested completions are presented while the user is typing.
          This usually involves searching and ranking matching candidate completions with really low latency -
          a suitable job for Vespa. Vespa features usually involved in this are:
        </p>
        <ul class="list p-l-30 p-b-10">
