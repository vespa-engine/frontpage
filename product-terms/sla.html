<p>
  This Vespa Cloud Service Level Agreement (referred to as the “SLA”) governs the use of the Vespa
  Cloud Service for paying customers and outlines the sole and exclusive remedies available in case of
  service disruptions or errors in the Vespa Cloud Service.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that this Service Level Agreement does not apply to non-paid access to the Vespa Cloud
  Service (e.g., beta/test or verification users).
</p>
<h2>1. Definitions</h2>
<p>
  "Monthly Uptime Percentage" is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of minutes
  during the month in which any of the Included Services experiences Unavailability.
</p>
<p>
  A "Service Credit" is a dollar credit, as detailed in section 2, that may be applied to an eligible
  account.
</p>
<p>
  Vespa Cloud Service is considered “Unavailable” when it fails to provide valid responses to requests.
</p>

<h2>2. Service Level</h2>
<p>
  Vespa will make every reasonable effort to ensure that the Vespa Cloud Service maintains a Monthly
  Uptime Percentage of at least 99.5%.
</p>
<p>
  If the Vespa Cloud Service does not meet this requirement for a given calendar month, the customers
  sole and exclusive remedy for any non-performance is eligibility to receive a Service Credit for that
  month:

<h2>3. SLA Credits</h2>
<p>
  Service Credits are calculated as a percentage of the monthly fees paid for using the Vespa Cloud
  Service.
</p>
<p>
  Service Credits will be applied solely to future recurring fee payments for the Vespa Cloud Service
  and are not eligible for refunds or other forms of payment from Vespa. They may not be transferred
  or applied to any other account.
</p>

<h2>4. Credit Request and Payment Procedures</h2>
<p>
  To request a Service Credit, you must submit a claim by opening a case in the Vespa Cloud Support
  Center at https://cloud.vespa.ai/support. Your credit request must be submitted no later than 7
  calendar days after the incident commenced. It should include the dates, times, and affected
  instances of each Unavailability incident you are claiming, along with your request logs and other
  necessary data for Vespa to validate the outage.
</p>
<h2>5. SLA Exclusions</h2>
<p>
  This SLA does not apply to any unavailability, suspension, or termination of the Vespa Cloud Service,
  or any other performance issues, directly or indirectly:
</p>
<p>
  (i) Resulting from factors beyond our reasonable control, including force majeure events or Internet
  access problems beyond Vespa&#39;s control. (ii) Arising from actions or inactions of you or any third
  party, such as misconfiguration, increased traffic, customer code, or failure to address resource
  capacity or health concerns. (iii) Resulting from your equipment, software, or other technology
  and/or third-party equipment, software, or other technology (except for third-party equipment
  under Vespa&#39;s direct control). (iv) Arising from Vespa&#39;s suspension or termination of your right to use
  the Vespa Cloud Service.
