Customer about the aforementioned legal requirements before the processing, unless Union or
Norwegian law prohibits such notification for the sake of important social interests. Subsequent
instructions may also be given by the Customer throughout the duration of the processing of Personal

Customer is in breach of the Prevailing Data Protection Legislation or any other legislation, Vespa.ai
shall immediately notify the Customer about this.
</li><li>Confidentiality: Vespa.ai has a duty of confidentiality regarding the documentation and the Personal
Data which it will have access to in accordance with the Service Agreement and ths DPA. This provision

demonstrate the above-mentioned confidentiality.
</li><li>Security measures: Vespa.ai confirms that it will take appropriate technical and organizational measures
to ensure that all processing under this DPA meets the requirements of the Prevailing Data Protection

</li><li>Assistance with inquiries: Vespa.ai shall assist the Customer in safeguarding the rights of the data
subjects. This applies, but is not limited to, providing information on how the Personal Data is

of Prevailing Data Protection Legislation or this DPA, which is deemed caused by acts by Vespa.ai or
any party under Vespa.ai’s responsibility and liability. The compensation shall be calculated according
to elapsed time and Vespa.ai&#39;s usual terms and hourly rates, or if this is not applicable, as agreed upon
between the Parties.
</li>
</ol>

<li>SECURITY AND BREACH</li>
<ol class="inner">


<li>Vespa.ai shall comply with the requirements for security measures according to the Prevailing Data
Protection Legislation. Vespa.ai shall at least be able to document routines and security measures that
meet these requirements, including, as appropriate, measures to prevent accessible or illegal
destruction or loss of data, unauthorized access to or dissemination of data, as well as any other use of
Personal Data that does not comply with this DPA, and measures to restore access to the Personal
Data in any event.
</li><li>Vespa.ai undertakes to notify the Customer without undue delay and at the latest within 24 hours if
Vespa.ai has information about, or reason to believe, that the Personal Data is used in an unauthorized
manner or otherwise handled in violation of the Prevailing Data Protection Legislation and / or the terms
of this DPA. This is especially true for any breach of Personal Data security that Vespa.ai becomes
aware of, including unauthorized access, dissemination, alteration, damage / destruction, but also for
any circumstance that may cause a change in the risk assessment, and which has or may have an
impact on data security.
</li><li>In the event of a Personal Data breach by Vespa.ai, Vespa.ai shall notify the Customer within 24 hours
of Vespa.ai becoming aware of the breach. Notification of breach shall contain, as a minimum, the
requirements of GDPR Article 33 (3), including:
- description of the nature of the Personal Data breach, including, where possible, the categories of and
approximate number of data subjects affected, and the categories of and approximate number of
Personal Data records concerned,
- the name and contact information of the data protection officer or other contact point where more
information can be obtained,
- description of the likely consequences of the Personal Data breach,
- description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the Customer to address the Personal
Data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.
</li><li>The Customer is responsible for sending a notification to the supervisory authority at the latest 72 hours
after the breach has been detected, and Vespa.ai shall not send such notification or contact the
supervisory authority without the instructions of the Customer. If all information cannot be provided in
the first notification, the information should be given successively as soon as it is available. In
accordance with section 3.4 above and in the event of a data security or Personal Data Breach by the
Customer, Vespa.ai shall assist the Customer in obtaining the necessary information as described in
GDPR Article 33 (3), cf. section 5.3 above.
</li><li>Any breach or suspicion of a breach to the Personal Data security at Vespa.ai shall be recorded,
hereafter logged and stored at Vespa.ai.
</li><li>Vespa.ai shall, without undue delay, correct or implement measures to prevent Personal Data breach
and nonconformities. Nonconformities or breach which Vespa.ai or its Sub-Processors are responsible
for shall be corrected or prevented at no charge to the Customer and must be documented.
</li><li>The security level of the processing shall take into account the nature of the Personal Data and the risk
for Personal Data breach for the data subjects. For this reason, Vespa.ai must conduct risk
assessments to ensure satisfactory data security.
</li>
</ol>

<li>TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE EU/EEA</li>
<ol class="inner">


<li>Any transfer of Personal Data to third countries or international organizations by Vespa.ai shall only

instructed to perform by the Customer, is required under EU or Norwegian law, Vespa.ai shall inform the
Customer of that legal requirement prior to processing unless that law prohibits such information on
important grounds of public interest.

international transfers in accordance with Chapter V of the GDPR.
</li><li>At the time of this DPA, Vespa.ai does not transfer Personal Data related to use of the Vespa Cloud
outside the EU/EEA. However, the Customer accepts and acknowledges that Vespa.ai, as part of
fulfilment of the Service Agreement, will collect, store and transfer certain data from use of the Vespa
