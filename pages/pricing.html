<p>Running big data applications is hard: It combines high availability, consistent low latency and distributed
state and computation. Outsource it to a team that has as their sole priority to do it well, and which have been
at it for many years. It is as easy as deploying your application on the Vespa cloud service available in
<a href="https://vespa.ai/documentation/reference/zones">AWS regions around the world</a>.</p>

<p>Vespa charges by the machine resources allocated to your applications in three dimensions:</p>

<table class="price">
<tr><td><b>Per vcpu hour:</b><td>$0.12</td>
<tr><td><b>Per memory Gb hour:</b><td>$0.012</td>
<tr><td><b>Per disk Gb hour:</b><td>$0.0004</td>
</table>

<p>In production zones, the resources you allocate are precisely what you specify in services.xml for the duration
the application is deployed.</p>

<p>In dev, and test zones, applications will by default be
<a href="https://vespa.ai/documentation/reference/environments">downscaled</a> and you will be charged for
the capacity actually used. In test zones, applications will only allocate resources while tests are running.</p>

<p>In addition to machine resource costs, network egress costs incurred by your application are passed on to you at
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/#Data_Transfer">standard AWS prices</a>.
These depends only on how you use your applications.</p>

<p><b>What you get:</b>

<ul class="offer">
<li>Your Vespa applications are managed by the world’s most experienced big data serving operations team.

<li>Application changes are
<a href="https://vespa.ai/documentation/automated-deployments">continuously, quickly and safely deployed to production</a>.

<li>You are automatically and safely kept on the latest production proven version of Vespa and OS -
ensuring security, and availability of the latest Vespa features with no effort required on your part.

<li><a href="https://vespa.ai/documentation/security-model">Strong security by default</a>:
All external and internal communications is secured with mutual TLS with
application-specific certificates. All applications run on dedicated VMs in isolated containers.

<li><b>Proactive operations</b> - Vespa operations will monitor and analyze your applications in production 24/7 and
react to potential problems.

<li><b>Application support</b> with response by the next business day by the team who develop Vespa.

<li>Convenient and fast application development by deploying any number of development copies of your
applications with seconds turnaround time to our development environment.

<li>All the <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/features.html">features of Vespa</a> are available just as
they would be in a self-hosted application, just without the effort of operating and securing it.
